# Pre-work - *TipCalc*

**TipCalc** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **David Ian Arizpe Arroyo**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Dark Mode
- [ ] Settings Page
- [ ] Update to UI to make it nicer and user friendly

## Notes

I first had an issue with linking the labels with the rest of the code given that I wasnt aware that I needed to link each label and so the application crashed when I entered a number because it had an issue with an optional variable. 
I also had an issue with github where Even though I was able to successfully connect my github to xcode. It would not push or pull nor would the files show up on github. This was odd given that everything seemed to have connected smoothly but that last part just didnt work, I have worked with gitLab before aswell so I know how to commit and pull items.
